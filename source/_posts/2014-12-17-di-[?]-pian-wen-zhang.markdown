### a little intro
I'm an infrequent blogger, I find I can't write routinely and my previous attempts at starting blogs all failed miserably{% fn_ref 1 %}. However there are many personal sites out there that I admire with some great content which always encourages me to try again - so here goes, another attempt starting in 2013. This time due to the platform, workflow and Apps I'm using I feel I may be a little bit more creative.

### Octopress and my current workflow
<center>{% img https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22370970/blogimages/octopress.jpg %}</center>
I like to get my hands dirty, even in my current day job (which is strictly management) I can't get by without some hands on, whether that be coding, diagnosing or generally rolling my sleeves up and getting stuck in, so [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) with its strap line of 'A blogging framework for hackers' got my attention last year and after inspecting closely and reading other people's experiences with it, I decided to give it a go.

As of this post I'm using Octopress on Mac OSX Mountain Lion, running on a MacBook Pro. The MBP has Wake On Demand enabled{% fn_ref 2 %} so I can tunnel in from anywhere I have an internet connection with my chosen SSH iOS App and generate and deploy to Github Pages (where this blog is currently hosted).
### content
I love [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), creating content with it is a joy and I don't have to code while I write or use awful CMS, it feels natural and the syntax is easy to remember. I also can't recommend highly enough [iA Writer](www.iawriter.com/). It's clean, minimal interface and focus on text along with its support for Markdown and integration with Dropbox is a must have on iOS for anyone with a similar setup. 
### Dropbox 
The entirety of this site is stored within my Dropbox account, this means that I can access and create posts using iA Writer and have them synced instantly back to my Mac. With Dropbox keeping [30 day snapshots](https://www.dropbox.com/help/11/) too, I have assurances that if I mess something up, I can revert back to a previous version of a configuration, stylesheet, markdown post or piece of code with ease.

I'm also hosting most of the sites images from Dropbox too, I love the idea that I have complete control and ownership of everything.
### theming
The default Octopress theme for me is too ugly and is found on so many other Octopress blogs that I just had to move away from it. I couldn't find a theme I liked 'out of the box' so therefore went with [the Slash theme](http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/) and started customising from there to get a clean, minimalistic feel. I've been hugely influenced by the design of [Guillermo Esteves blog](http://blog.gesteves.com/) (also using Octopress), I think it's damn near perfect, so I'm aiming to get a similar look and feel over time{% fn_ref 3 %}.
### what next?

I've purchased a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) this weekend, the latest 512Mb edition to be exact, so my plan going forward is to use the Pi as my Octopress staging platform. It's going to be ideal as a low powered always on server I can SSH in to, no longer having to rely on my MacBook Pro and as of this post I have 1 week to wait before I get my hands on it and start hacking away - I can't wait and will no doubt share the experiences going forward.
